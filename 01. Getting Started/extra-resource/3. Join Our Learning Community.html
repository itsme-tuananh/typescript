<p>As a student of this course you also get free access to our “<a href="https://academind.com/community/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Academind Community</strong></a>”.</p><p>There, you can find <strong>like-minded people</strong>, <strong>discuss</strong> issues, <strong>help each other</strong>, share progress, successes and ideas and simply <strong>have a good time</strong>!</p><p>I believe that you learn the most if you <strong>don’t learn alone </strong>but find learning partners and other people with similar interests.
